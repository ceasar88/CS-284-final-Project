# Project Title: Predicting Off-target activity scores in CRISPR-Cas9 gRNA gene editing

## Introduction and Problem Statement: 
#### Motivation 

The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technology hasrevolutionized gene editing and brought new hope for future disease prevention, aging, and even sparked talk of ‘designer dna’ (the trendy name for potential  aesthetic gene editing). Perhaps the biggest flaw in the Crispr technology is the inability to accurately predict  the effects of editing a certain gene using a specific guide Ribonucleic acid(RNA). Many solutions to the problem(predicting off-target activity) have been proposed.  Included among these are the Elevation and Crispor algorithms that use machine  learning to predict off-target activity for end-to-end gRNA design. 

### Problem Statement 
Given a DNA target-gRNA pair, can we predict the risk of off-target activity if the  Crispr technology were to be deployed for gene editing using that specific pair. This  project looks to apply different artificial neural network models towards predicting  off-target activity when using Crispr gRNAs.
